# The Open Source Society

Hi, everyone. Welcome to The Open Source Society!

This repository contains the resources and other related material to The Open Source Society.

## Aim

The primary goal of our club is to help our members learn to think logically, express their thoughts through code, help them discover programming tools.

## Affiliation

It should be noted that, this club is not affiliated to Presidency University in anyway other than the founders being students there. However, we are working towards incorporating the club with the university. However, we cannot make any promises as of now.

Further, we are trying to include faculties who are really intelligent and can help us learn more.

## Doubts

Do not feel shy to ask any doubts on the group.  Regardless of our expertise,
all of us were once beginners who didn't know anything. In fact, you can always
contact us (i.e., Samuel Rowe and Joel Rego) directly if you want to, in person
or through WhatsApp. We will try our best to help you out. Do not hesitate to ask,
because we are here to learn.

## Benefits

During the interview, we came across a lot of plagiarized solutions. You need to
understand that, you are not getting anything out of this club, marks, credits,
popularity, or even money. The only thing you have to gain through this club is
experience in coding and knowledge. If you do not implement the solution through
your capabilities, there is really no point in submitting the solution. In other
words, you are wasting your time as well as our time.

However, we do not hold any thing against you, if you did plagiarize. In fact,
we encourage you to stay in the club and spectate our activity. In this way,
you may find the inspiration you need.

Apart from that, you will have the following benefits:
 * You can include your membership in this club in your resume. We am sure it will add some weight.
 * You get to learn how the open source community works.
 * You get to learn how programming tools work, other than what you learn at college.
 * You will learn many things beyond the things included in your syllabus at college.
 * You will have mentors like Joel and I. We can guide you with things that we wish somebody told us when we began coding.
 * You get to meet new people who share common interests.

## Activities

Every week you will be given two assignment sets.

The first assignment set will be related to JTK for which you will need to write
your solution in C. This assignment will help you learn to express your thoughts
in terms of code. If your work is satisfies our standards, we will allow you to
merge your code with our repository.

The second assignment set will be related to a puzzle that will help you think
and develop your logical thinking skills. You can choose any language to implement
this assignment set.

Each assignment set will contain at most 5 problem statements. It is not mandatory
for you to solve all the problem statements.

## Scoring

*We are yet to come up with a scoring mechanism.*

The scoring system is here to encourage competitive behavior among the members,
and not to criticize or discriminate the members in anyway.

## Exit

You are free to leave the club whenever you want. :)
