## Activity Set 1

 1. Create your GitHub profile, if you don't have one.
 
 2. Learn the Google style conventions for Java, C, C++, and Python. You can choose to learn the conventions only for the languages you know. For example, if you know only C then learn the conventions only for C. I have attached the link to Googles Java style conventions. You can Google for other languages. Please post the links on the group if you find the others so others can use it.

   [Python](http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html)  
   
 3. Create a repository on your GitHub with the name: toss-solutions.  
   You need to upload all your coding solutions here. You need to use Git to upload your solutions to GitHub, which brings us to the fourth question.

 4. Install Git on your system.  
    
    If you are a Windows user, please install MSYS2 or WSL. You then need to install Git on MSYS2 or WSL. The reason is we will be using other tools in the future. Installing these tools is a headache directly, because each installation requires different procedure. MSYS2 and WSL provide a Linux environment on Windows. Which makes things easier for installing the required tools.  
    
    Learn the difference between WSL and MSYS2. This is the only theoretical question for this week. But it will help you in the long run. You need to find your own resources for this. :)
    
 5. Learn how to write documents in Markdown.
    
    Markdown is a simple markup language for writing simple documents with basic text formatting.
